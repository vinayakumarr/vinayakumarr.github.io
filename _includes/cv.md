I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham in Computational Engineering and Networking (CEN). I am  with the <a href='https://vinayakumarr.github.io/Cybersecurity-Lab-at-CEN/' target='_blank'> Cybersecurity-Lab-at-CEN </a> and <a href='https://vinayakumarr.github.io/ComputationalThinking-Lab-at-CEN/' target='_blank'> Computational Thinking-Lab-at-CEN </a>, advised by <a href='http://nlp.amrita.edu/somankp/' target='_blank'> Prof. Soman KP </a> on Artificial intelligence and most specifically, Machine Learning, Data mining and Deep learning, Big Data Analytics, Natural language processing and Signal and Image processing for Cyber Security. I spent the first two years of my Ph.D. working on traditional machine learning for various use-cases of Cyber Security and now I am working on deep learning for network traffic analysis, android malware detection, spam detection, log analysis, insider threat detection and ransomware detection. I am particularly interested in improving the malicious detection rate through the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), including machine learning, data mining, deep learning and natural language processing.

Cybersecurity group at CEN is organizing a shared task in Cybersecurity domain. More details avilable at [DMD2018](http://nlp.amrita.edu/DMD2018/)

I strongly believe in open science and reproducible research and actively publish code on my [Github profile](https://github.com/vinayakumarr/).<br><br>
<b>I am on the job market for an industry machine learning research position.</b>
